# Traffic-Offentder-Tracking-System
A desktop application for tracking offender in a traffic. The app was built for a master project.
Visual studio 2013 was used in developing it.
C#.Net the primary and major programming languaged used.
The database is SQL-Lite. I used this for testing the app in different targeted systems since it is a stand-alone app.
